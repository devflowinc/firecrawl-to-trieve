Chunk 2:
### Keeping your data updated (Auto Sync)

Mendable now offers reingestion for all users through the dashboard. To activate it, go to the Manage Indexes page. After you ingested from a data source that is supported (Website/Docs, GitHub, Notion, Zendesk + others), an auto sync option will appear in the Manage indexes page. You can then activate it and this will auto sync your data every 24 hours.
